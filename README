NAME
    SHARYANTO::Module::Util - Module-related utilities

VERSION
    version 0.04

SYNOPSIS
     use SHARYANTO::Module::Util qw(
         is_xs is_pp
     );

     say "Class::XSAccessor is an XS module" if is_xs("Class/XSAccessor.pm");
     say "JSON::PP is a pure-Perl module" if is_pp("JSON::PP");

DESCRIPTION
FUNCTIONS
  is_xs($mod, \%opts) => BOOL
    Return true if module $mod is an XS module, false if a pure Perl module,
    or undef if can't determine either. $mod value can be in the form of
    "Package/SubPkg.pm" or "Package::SubPkg". The following ways are tried,
    in order:

    *   Looking at the ".packlist"

        If a .{bs,so,dll} file is listed in the ".packlist", then it is
        assumed to be an XS module. This method will fail if there is no
        ".packlist" available (e.g. core or uninstalled or when the package
        management strips the packlist), or if a dist contains both
        pure-Perl and XS.

    *   Looking at the source file for usage of "XSLoader" or "DynaLoader"

        If the module source code has something like "use XSLoader;" or <use
        DynaLoader;> then it is assumed to be an XS module. This is
        currently implemented using a simple regex, so it is somewhat
        brittle.

    *   Guessing from the name

        If the module has "XS" in its name then it's assumed to be an XS
        module. If the module has "PP" in its name, it's assumed to be a
        pure-Perl module.

        Known false positives will be prevented in the future.

    Other methods will be added in the future (e.g. a database like in
    Module::CoreList, consulting MetaCPAN, etc).

    Options:

    *   warn => BOOL (default: 0)

        If set to true, will warn to STDERR if fail to determine.

    *   debug => BOOL (default: 0)

        If set to true will print debugging message to STDERR.

  is_pp($mod, \%opts) => BOOL
    The opposite of "is_xs", return true if module $mod is a pure Perl
    module. See "is_xs" for more details.
